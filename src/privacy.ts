<h1>AirTreks MCP Server Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><em>Effective July 13, 2026</em></p>

<p>The AirTreks MCP Server (<code>mcp.airtreks.com</code>) is operated by AirTreks
(<a href="https://airtreks.com">airtreks.com</a>). It provides flight-routing tools
to AI agents and assistants. This policy describes what data the server collects
and how it is used.</p>

<h2>What we collect</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Request metadata.</strong> Your IP address, used for rate limiting and
daily aggregate usage statistics (request counts and unique-visitor counts).</li>
<li><strong>Tool inputs.</strong> The parameters sent to routing tools (city codes,
dates, preferences) are used to answer the request and recorded as aggregate
counters of which tools and routes are queried.</li>
<li><strong>API key registration.</strong> If you request an API key via
<code>POST /register</code>, we store the email address and optional name you provide.</li>
<li><strong>Trip ideas.</strong> If an agent calls <code>trip_idea_create</code> (API-key
tier only), the customer contact details (email, name, phone) and trip details in
that request are forwarded to AirTreks' booking system so a human travel consultant
can follow up. Only submit this data with the customer's knowledge and consent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What we do not collect</h2>
<ul>
<li>No conversation content beyond the tool parameters an agent sends.</li>
<li>No cookies, tracking pixels, or advertising identifiers.</li>
<li>We never sell or rent any data to third parties.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who receives the data</h2>
<p>Data stays within AirTreks. Trip ideas go to AirTreks' customer-relationship
system for consultant follow-up. The server is hosted on Railway (United States).</p>

<h2>Retention</h2>
<p>Usage statistics are stored as daily aggregates for service operation. API key
records are kept until you ask us to remove them. Trip-idea data is handled under
AirTreks' customer data practices.</p>

<h2>Your choices</h2>
<p>To access or delete your API key record or any data submitted about you, email
<a href="mailto:sean@airtreks.com">sean@airtreks.com</a>. We respond to all requests.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>Updates to this policy are posted at this URL.</p>
